         <h3 class="color"> Bruteforce </h3>
         <p> A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. 
         The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.
         Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password.
         As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.
         There are two types of bruteforce i.e.Regular bruteforce and Reverse bruteforce. 
         Unlike regular Bruteforce,In  Reverse Bruteforce, a single password is taken and is used in different accounts.The tool that I use is <span class="color">Dark-FB-Gold</span>.

     <h3 class="color">Phishing</h3>
     <p> Phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. 
     It is usually done through email. 
     The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information, or to install malware on the victimâ€™s machine.
     It creates a fake site which usually looks legit and the victim enters their information believing that the site is legit. But their information goes to the hacker.
     This is how many bank accounts gets hacked.The tool that I have used here is <span class="color">NexPhisher</span>.
